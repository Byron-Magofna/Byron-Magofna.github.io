    <h2>My First Post!</h2>
    <p>October 10th, 2021</p>
    <p>Question:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The only challenge I had completing this assignment 
                was with accessing my github repository through my 
                terminal. It wouldn't accept my username and password 
                to log in, so I had to create a Personal Access Token 
                to be able to log in.</li>
            <li>I already knew how to do everything in this assignment but it was a great refresher!</li>
            <li>I used the class notes that I had for HTML and I also googled how to underline text.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>My Second Post for Assignment 2!</h2>
    <p>October 25th, 2021</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>The greatest challenge I had while doing this Assignment was getting the Flex property to work properly. 
            I finally got it to work through trial and error.</li>
        <li>The biggest resources I used was definitely the notes I took from class. They were really helpful. 
            I also used google for a few things.</li>
        <li>I learned a ton about flex properties and hover properties. 
            The properties I already knew about was the padding and margins properties.</li>
        <li>One small thing I had to google was how to underline and remove underlined text.</li>
        <li>I actually had a lot of fun working on this assignment!</li>
    </ul></p>
