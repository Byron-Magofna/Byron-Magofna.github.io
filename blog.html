    <p>Question:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The only challenge I had completing this assignment 
                was with accessing my github repository through my 
                terminal. It wouldn't accept my username and password 
                to log in, so I had to create a Personal Access Token 
                to be able to log in.</li>
            <li>I already knew how to do everything in this assignment but it was a great refresher!</li>
            <li>I used the class notes that I had for HTML and I also googled how to underline text.</li>
        </ul>
