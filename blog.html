                                <li>The only challenge I had completing this assignment 
                                    was with accessing my github repository through my 
                                    terminal. It wouldn't accept my username and password 
                                    to log in, so I had to create a Personal Access Token 
                                    to be able to log in.</li>
                                <li>I already knew how to do everything in this assignment but it was a great refresher!</li>
                                <li>I used the class notes that I had for HTML and I also googled how to underline text.</li>

                                    I finally got it to work through trial and error.</li>
                                <li>The biggest resources I used was definitely the notes I took from class. They were really helpful. 
                                    I also used google for a few things.</li>
                                <li>I learned a ton about flex properties and hover properties. 
                                    The properties I already knew about was the padding and margins properties.</li>
                                <li>One small thing I had to google was how to underline and remove underlined text.</li>
                                <li>I actually had a lot of fun working on this assignment!</li>

                                <li>My biggest issue was that I had very little time to work on it. 
                                    I had a group midterm project that was due a day before this assignment and that 
                                    took up almost all of my time. I was only able to work on this for about a day and a half.</li>
                                <li>My biggest issue with the assignment was accessing the values of elements. I still don't know how 
                                    to access certain values of elements after I have put those elements into a variable Example: (var 
                                    element = document.getElementById('ID Name').value) but if I have an array of class names how would 
                                    I access an individual value from that array?</li>
                                <li>I had to google a lot of different JS properties because I wasn't sure how to use it or what it was for.</li>
                                <li>The class notes were very helpful for most of the assignment that I was able to complete.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The biggest problem that I encountered was simply understanding 
                                    how to send the data back to the browser. As soon as I figured 
                                    out how to do that with the "res.write()" function it was really 
                                    simple! The other slight problem I had was getting the Benny.jpg 
                                    to display. I found out that it wouldn't display because I had the 
                                    "utf-8" parameter in the readFile function.</li>
                                <li>Like always, the lecture notes and example code were extremely helpful!</li>
                                <li>I kept trying to Google how to read in an image correctly since I couldn't 
                                    get mine to display correctly. But it didn't really help at all.</li>
                            </ul>
